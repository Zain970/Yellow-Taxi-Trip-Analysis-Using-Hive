Problem statement:-
====================
->In this case study, we are giving a real world example of how to use HIVE on top of the HADOOP for different exploratory data analysis. In here, we have a predefined dataset (2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv) having more than 15 columns and more than 100000 records in it. The dataset has different attributes like

vendor_id string,
pickup_datetime string,
dropoff_datetime string,
passenger_count int,
trip_distance DECIMAL(9,6),
pickup_longitude DECIMAL(9,6),
pickup_latitude DECIMAL(9,6),
rate_code int,
store_and_fwd_flag string,
dropoff_longitude DECIMAL(9,6),
dropoff_latitude DECIMAL(9,6),
payment_type string,
fare_amount DECIMAL(9,6),
extra DECIMAL(9,6),
mta_tax DECIMAL(9,6),
tip_amount DECIMAL(9,6),
tolls_amount DECIMAL(9,6),
total_amount DECIMAL(9,6),
trip_time_in_secs int
 

Perform taxi trip analysis by solving the questions below:
===========================================================

1).What is the total Number of trips ( equal to the number of rows)?
2).What is the total revenue generated by all the trips? The fare is stored in the column total_amount.
3).What fraction of the total is paid for tolls? The toll is stored in tolls_amount.
4).What fraction of it is driver tips? The tip is stored in tip_amount.
5).What is the average trip amount?
6).What is the average distance of the trips? Distance is stored in the column trip_distance.
7).How many different payment types are used?
8).For each payment type, display the following details:
   Average fare generated
   Average tip
   Average tax â€“ tax is stored in column mta_tax
9).On average which hour of the day generates the highest revenue?

Tasks related to taxi data:
==========================

1).Create a table named taxidata . Required ddl script is given below.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS taxidata(
     vendor_id string, 
     pickup_datetime string,
     dropoff_datetime string, 
     passenger_count int, 
     trip_distance DECIMAL(9,6),
     pickup_longitude DECIMAL(9,6), 
     pickup_latitude DECIMAL(9,6), 
     rate_code int,
     store_and_fwd_flag string, 
     dropoff_longitude DECIMAL(9,6), 
     dropoff_latitude DECIMAL(9,6),
     payment_type string, 
     fare_amount DECIMAL(9,6), 
     extra DECIMAL(9,6),
     mta_tax DECIMAL(9,6), 
     tip_amount DECIMAL(9,6), 
     tolls_amount DECIMAL(9,6),
     total_amount DECIMAL(9,6), 
     trip_time_in_secs int 
)

ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED as TEXTFILE
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1")

2).Load data from the csv file - 2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data..csv

3).Run some basic queries to check the data is loaded properly
